Chef has an array A containing N non-negative integers.
He will perform a sequence of operations on this array.
The X-th operation is as follows:
For each index i (1≤i≤N), either leave Aiunchanged, or replace Ai with Ai|X

The choice is made independently for each index.
Here, ∣ denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Find the minimum number of operations needed for Chef to be able to obtain an array that's sorted in non-decreasing order
It can be proved that the answer is finite.
If the array is already sorted, output 0.
